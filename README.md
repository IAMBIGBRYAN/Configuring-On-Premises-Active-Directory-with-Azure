<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

Implementing an on-premises Active Directory (AD) environment within Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) is a common scenario for organizations looking to extend their existing on-premises AD infrastructure into the cloud. This allows for seamless integration with Azure services and hybrid identity management. Below is a detailed outline of the implementation process:

**1. Preparation:

a. Azure Subscription: Ensure you have an active Azure subscription to create and manage Azure resources.

b. Network Planning: Plan your Azure network topology, including Virtual Networks (VNets), subnets, and IP addressing. Decide whether you will use a VPN, Azure ExpressRoute, or Azure AD Connect for connectivity between on-premises and Azure.

c. Azure AD: If you don't already have an Azure AD tenant, create one. Azure AD will be used for identity and access management.

d. Azure Resource Group: Create an Azure Resource Group to organize your Azure resources logically.

2. Set Up On-Premises Active Directory:

a. Install and Configure Domain Controllers: Set up one or more domain controllers (DCs) on your on-premises network. Ensure they are running the Windows Server operating system and are part of your AD domain.

b. Configure DNS: Configure DNS on your DCs to resolve both internal and external DNS queries. Ensure DNS resolution is working correctly.

c. Configure Sites and Subnets: Configure Active Directory Sites and Subnets in AD Sites and Services to represent your network topology.

3. Set Up Azure Infrastructure:

a. Azure Virtual Network: Create a Virtual Network (VNet) in Azure to mimic your on-premises network. Define subnets and address spaces that match your on-premises network.

b. Azure Virtual Machines: Create Azure VMs that will serve as domain controllers in Azure. These VMs should be running Windows Server and joined to your on-premises AD domain.

c. Azure VPN Gateway (Optional): If you choose to use a VPN connection for on-premises-to-Azure connectivity, create an Azure VPN Gateway.

d. Azure ExpressRoute (Optional): If you choose to use Azure ExpressRoute for a dedicated and private connection, set it up with your network service provider.

4. Azure AD Connect Installation:

a. Azure AD Connect Server: Set up an Azure AD Connect server in your on-premises network. This server will synchronize your on-premises AD with Azure AD.

b. Installation and Configuration: Install Azure AD Connect on the server and configure it to synchronize user accounts, passwords, and optionally, groups and attributes.

c. Password Hash Synchronization (PHS) or Pass-Through Authentication (PTA): Configure PHS or PTA for user sign-in to Azure services.

5. Synchronize On-Premises AD with Azure AD:

a. Initial Synchronization: Run the initial synchronization to replicate user accounts and passwords from on-premises AD to Azure AD.

b. Ongoing Synchronization: Configure scheduled synchronization tasks to keep both environments up to date.

6. Network Connectivity:

a. VPN Connection (if applicable): If using a VPN connection, configure the VPN tunnel between your on-premises network and Azure VNet.

b. DNS Configuration: Ensure DNS resolution between on-premises and Azure resources is functional.

7. Test and Validate:

a. User Sign-In: Test user sign-in to Azure resources using on-premises AD credentials.

b. Group Policies: Verify that Group Policies are applied correctly to Azure VMs.

c. Access Control: Ensure proper access control and permissions between on-premises and Azure resources.

8. Monitor and Maintain:

a. Monitoring: Implement monitoring and alerting solutions to track the health and performance of your AD environment.

b. Backup and Disaster Recovery: Implement backup and disaster recovery solutions for both on-premises and Azure-based AD components.

9. Documentation:

a. Documentation: Maintain detailed documentation of your Azure AD and on-premises AD configurations, network topology, and synchronization settings.

10. Security Best Practices:

a. Security: Implement security best practices, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), conditional access policies, and regular security assessments.

11. Scaling and Growth:

a. Scaling: Plan for scaling your Azure infrastructure as your organization's needs grow. Add additional domain controllers, configure load balancing, and optimize resources.

This implementation outline provides a comprehensive guide for setting up an on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines. Keep in mind that specific requirements and configurations may vary depending on your organization's needs and the complexity of your existing AD infrastructure. Always consult Azure documentation and consider engaging with Azure experts for complex deployments.
